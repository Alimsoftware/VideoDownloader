## Bitwise Operators

**Shift**: The bitwise shift operators shift the contents of an integer variable by a specified number of bits to the left or right. The >> operator shifts bits to the right, and the << operator shifts bits to the left.|

**∼**: The bitwise complement operator is a unary operator that inverts the bits in its operand, so 1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1.

**&**: The bitwise AND operator ANDs corresponding bits in its operands. If the corresponding bits are both 1, then the resulting bit is 1; otherwise, it’s 0.

**^**: The bitwise exclusive OR operator or XOR operator exclusive-ORs corresponding bits in its operands. If the corresponding bits are different, then the result is 1. If the corresponding bits are the same, the result is 0.

**|**: The bitwise OR operator ORs corresponding bits in its operands. If either bit is 1, then the result is 1. If both bits are 0, then the result is 0.
